TAU must be configured with -dyninst=download or -dyninst=$PATH_TO_DYNINST

This example works with hdf5, install it with: spack install hdf5 +mpi +cxx

To run this example follow the next steps:

1. Compile the application with make (Change the path to hdf5)
2. Include the TAU executables in your path, export PATH=$HOME/tau2/x86_64/bin/:$PATH
3. Include both Dyninst and TAU libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/tau2/x86_64/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/dyninst/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
4. Set the DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB, DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB=$HOME/dyninst/lib/libdyninstAPI_RT.so
5. Check the libraries used by the executable with: ldd h5ex_d_hyper
6. Instrument the hdf5 library that ldd printed, i.e.: libhdf5.so.310
	tau_run -v -l -T mpi ${HDF5_PATH}/lib/libhdf5.so.310 -o libhdf5.so.310
7. If you use ldd again, you will see that the original library is used, export your current path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
8. Check again and you should see that now the modified library is shown
9. Execute the program with TAU, mpirun -np 2 tau_exec -T mpi ./parallel2darray
10. See the results, pprof -a
